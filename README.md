# Explanations

This repository is done in an intent to build a library of navbars made in CSS, Bootstrap and others.
The idea is to build a way and discuss the best approaches for as many situations as possible, counting with the 
contribution of many expertises such as full stack developers, front-ends, Web Designers and others to present
to the world easy to build, flexible and accurate ways to build navbars for a site.

## Why?

On this repository you will find some Pre-built navbars that I have made myself while studying CSS. Hopefully more
will contribute and who knows we can build some sort of cheatsheet for navbars since this seems to be the subject
of confusion to some. Specially when building something a bit more complex than just float: right; float: left; 
sort of situation.

## Is it free? Is there a license? Is it open for contribution?

I thank those who contribute, all source here are open, free to use, without a license and is made for contribution.
Hopefully I can count with you all.

Thank you and Have a great day!
